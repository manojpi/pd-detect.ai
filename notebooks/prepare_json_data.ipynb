    "    \"Parkinson's diagnosis involves a combination of neurological exams and symptom evaluation, with tests like dopamine transporter scans aiding in more challenging cases.\",\n",
    "    \"Dopamine is critical in Parkinson's because the disease leads to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, impacting smooth muscle control and causing tremors and stiffness.\",\n",
    "    \"Genetic factors include mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA genes, which increase risk, although most cases remain idiopathic with no specific genetic link.\",\n",
    "    \"Lifestyle adjustments such as regular exercise and balanced nutrition may improve symptoms and slow disease progression, though it’s not a substitute for medical treatment.\",\n",
    "    \"Treatment includes medications that replace or mimic dopamine, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery like deep brain stimulation for advanced cases.\",\n",
    "    \"Parkinson's gradually impacts motor control, leading to symptoms like tremors, bradykinesia (slow movement), and muscle stiffness, progressing in severity over time.\",\n",
    "    \"Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but treatments and therapies help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\",\n",
    "    \"Non-motor symptoms may include depression, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and a diminished sense of smell, often appearing in early or later stages.\",\n",
    "    \"Family members can provide essential support through emotional encouragement, assistance with mobility, and helping manage medications.\",\n",
    "    \"The loss of dopamine is due to the death of neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra, often related to genetics and environmental factors.\",\n",
    "    \"Parkinson's can affect mental health, leading to conditions such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment.\",\n",
    "    \"Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain to reduce symptoms like tremor and rigidity, often used in advanced cases.\",\n",
    "    \"Progression varies but generally involves worsening motor symptoms and can range from mild to severe over 10 to 20 years.\",\n",
    "    \"A balanced diet may improve symptom management, although there is no evidence linking diet directly to disease prevention.\",\n",
    "    \"There are no proven preventive measures, but lifestyle choices like exercise may lower risk and help manage symptoms if developed.\",\n",
    "    \"Daily life is impacted through motor issues, cognitive changes, and reduced independence, affecting activities like dressing and eating.\",\n",
    "    \"Parkinson’s typically progresses through five stages, from mild symptoms to severe disability requiring assistance.\",\n",
    "    \"In some cases, Parkinson's can lead to dementia, especially in advanced stages.\",\n",
    "    \"Current research focuses on neuroprotective treatments, stem cell therapy, and genetic research to find a cure.\",\n",

    "    \"Medications like levodopa help increase dopamine levels, improving motor symptoms but require careful management.\",\n",
